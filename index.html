    <p> Dinosaurs were some of the most remarkable creatures ever to walk the Earth. They first appeared over 230
        million years ago during the Triassic<span class="redtext">this is a span what changes</span> period and dominated the planet for more than 160 million years. These
        ancient reptiles came in an astonishing variety of shapes and sizes—from the towering Brachiosaurus, which
        stretched as tall as a four-story building, to the swift and feathered Velociraptor, no bigger than a modern-day
        turkey.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Despite their differences, dinosaurs shared a world that was dramatically unlike our own: lush forests of giant
        ferns, active volcanoes, and shifting continents. Some dinosaurs were fearsome predators with razor-sharp teeth,
        while others were peaceful plant-eaters equipped with long necks, horns, or armored plates for protection.</p>
    <br>
    <p>reign came to an abrupt end around 66 million years ago, likely due to a massive asteroid impact that drastically
        changed the planet’s climate. Yet dinosaurs live on today through their closest living relatives: birds.</p>
